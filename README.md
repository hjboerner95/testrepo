Hello fellow SMU Data Science classmates and the cyberworld.  Looking forward to this fun adventure.  Below is my Data Science profile that the entire class outlined where we are in different catagores of Data Science.  Let's see what this will look like when we are finished wiht the semester.

Computer Programming - 2
Math - 2
Statistics - 2
Machine Learning - 1
Domain Expertise - 4
     Retail: 2
     Consulting: 4
     Financial Services: 3
     Project / Program Management: 4
Communication and Presentation Skills - 4
Data Visualization - 3
Research - 3
Artificial Intelligence - 1 

I am hoping to improve the most the area of Statistics and Programming. 

I don't think anyone will ever be an expert in anything.  My definition is that you will never know everything that there is about a subject.  Everyone is always learning.

The one thing that I want to learn the most about is Machine Learning.  Right now, I don't really understand what it is and how it relates to my job / function.

I added research and artificial intelligence.

	Research - In my mind, a good Data Scientist needs to be a good researcher as well.  A lot of what you need to do is find details out of chaos.
 
	Artificial Intelligence - This is becoming a major part of Big Data and in order for this area to grow, the scientists are going to need data scientists to help them understand the next wave of data.
